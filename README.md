This application was bootstrapped with create-react-app. It uses Material-UI for styling, and Formik+Yup for forms/validation.

To start the application, download the directory to your local machine with the latest version of nodejs already installed. 

Run 'npm install' in the directory, and then npm start. You should see the application launch in the browser.

To run e2e test, run 'npx cypress open' from another terminal in the root directory of the project with the app already running



I've also included the Lisp Parenthesis Checker in this application. It can be run by running 'node checker.js' from the lisp-checker directory, and entering a test string when asked.
